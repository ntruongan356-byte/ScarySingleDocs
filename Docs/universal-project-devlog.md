UNIVERSAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT & DEVELOPMENT LOG

Purpose: A living document for any developer, analyst, or AI agent involved in a technical documentation project. It combines static, evergreen instructions for project execution with a dynamic log for recording progress, decisions, and challenges.
Part 1: The Project Management Guide (Static Instructions)
1.1 Mission Briefing

Your primary task is to produce or continue the in-depth documentation of a target software system. This involves analyzing the complete execution chain of a designated component or feature, documenting every function and dependency according to the established high-quality standard, and meticulously maintaining all progress-tracking documents.
1.2 Core Mandates & Quality Standards

These rules are the foundation of high-quality documentation and are non-negotiable.

    Adhere to the Master Template: All documentation must strictly follow the format defined in the project's "Universal Component Analysis & Documentation Plan." The designated "gold standard" document (e.g., example-analysis.md) should be used as a reference.

    Ensure 100% Coverage: Every function, method, parameter, and return value within the scope of analysis must be documented.

    Maintain Documentation Quality: The established quality standard (e.g., 9.5/10) must be maintained. Documentation should be clear, technically accurate, and professional.

    Update Tracking Documents: All to-do lists and progress summaries must be updated at the end of every work session to ensure project visibility.

1.3 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

For each component or group of components you are assigned:

    Review Source Materials: Read this guide, the universal plan, and the relevant master analysis document to understand the context and requirements.

    Analyze the Code: Perform the 9-Level Execution Chain analysis (or the project's chosen methodology) to fully understand the component's functionality and dependencies.

    Create Documentation Content: Write the analysis using the master template.

    Insert into Master Document: Insert your new analysis into the relevant master analysis document (e.g., component-analysis.md) at the designated insertion point, using the standard section format.

    Update Metadata & Logs: Update the Table of Contents, any line number references, the relevant to-do list, and add a detailed entry to the Development Log in this file.

1.4 Project Status Template

(This section should be updated by the project lead to reflect the current state.)

    Current Focus: [Name of the Component/Feature currently being analyzed, e.g., "Authentication Module"]

    Overall Progress: [Percentage]% of the current focus area is documented.

    Completed Components:

        [List of previously completed modules/files/features]

        [Another completed component]

    Documentation Quality Score: [Current Score]/10

1.5 Immediate Priorities Template

(This section should be updated by the project lead to outline the next steps.)

    [Next Priority Item 1] (CRITICAL): [Brief description of the task]

    [Next Priority Item 2] (HIGH): [Brief description of the task]

    [Next Priority Item 3] (MEDIUM): [Brief description of the task]

Part 2: Development & Changelog (Dynamic Log)
2.1 Instructions for Logging

After completing a set of tasks, create a new entry at the top of the log. Be detailed in your descriptions. This log is the primary record of the project's evolution, the reasoning behind key decisions, and a valuable resource for future contributors.
2.2 Log Entry Template

**Timestamp:** `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`
**Author/AI Model:** `[Your Name or AI Model/Version]`
**Tasks Completed:**
- `[A clear, concise summary of the first major task completed.]`
- `[A summary of the second task, etc.]`
**Files Modified/Created:**
- `[List of files that were significantly changed or newly created.]`
**Key Decisions/Challenges:**
- **Decision:** `[Describe any important decisions made and the reasoning behind them. e.g., "Decided to refactor the documentation template to be more agnostic."]`
- **Challenge:** `[Describe any obstacles encountered and how they were overcome. e.g., "The original source files had conflicting information, which was resolved by synthesizing them into a new master document."]`
**Next Steps:**
- `[Briefly state the immediate next tasks to be undertaken.]`

2.3 Log Entries

Author/AI Model: Gemini-1.5-Pro (Internal Build v1.2)
Tasks Completed:

    Synthesized multiple project management, overview, and analysis files into a new, three-document master suite.

    Restructured this file (UNIVERSAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT & DEVELOPMENT LOG) to include a dynamic changelog section and be fully project-agnostic.

    Refined the MASTER PROJECT OVERVIEW & README to be a comprehensive, standalone guide to the project's features and architecture.

    Validated the separation of the MASTER TECHNICAL ANALYSIS & ARCHITECTURAL SUMMARY from the universal template guide.
    Files Modified/Created:

    Created MASTER PROJECT OVERVIEW & README (New).

    Created UNIVERSAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT & DEVELOPMENT LOG (New, based on merged sources).

    Created MASTER TECHNICAL ANALYSIS & ARCHITECTURAL SUMMARY (New, based on merged sources).
    Key Decisions/Challenges:

    Decision: It was determined that separating the generic template/methodology from project-specific reports (overview, summary) is critical for maintaining the universality and clarity of the documentation framework.

    Challenge: Merging information from multiple guides required careful synthesis to avoid redundancy while preserving all unique, valuable instructions. The creation of a "Static Instructions" part and a "Dynamic Log" part for this document was the chosen solution.
    Next Steps:

    Proceed with the analysis of the project's designated next component.

    Use the newly created master documents as the primary reference for all future work.

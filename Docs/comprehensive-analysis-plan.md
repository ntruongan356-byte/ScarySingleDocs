# Comprehensive File Analysis Plan for sdAIgen Project

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic approach for analyzing the remaining files in the sdAIgen project, following the same thorough methodology used for setup.py. The plan ensures comprehensive understanding of each file's functionality, dependencies, and interconnections within the project ecosystem.

## Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: File Structure Analysis
For each file, we will analyze:
1. **File Purpose and Role**: Primary function within the project
2. **Dependencies**: External and internal dependencies
3. **Import/Export Relationships**: What the file imports and what it exports
4. **Key Functions and Classes**: Core functionality breakdown
5. **Configuration Points**: Settings and parameters it manages
6. **Integration Points**: How it connects with other files

### Phase 2: Functional Decomposition
For each file, we will:
1. **Function-Level Analysis**: Detailed examination of each function
2. **Data Flow Analysis**: How data moves through the system
3. **Control Flow Analysis**: Execution paths and decision points
4. **Error Handling**: Exception management and recovery strategies
5. **Performance Considerations**: Optimization opportunities and bottlenecks

### Phase 3: Interconnection Mapping
We will map:
1. **Call Graphs**: Function calls between files
2. **Data Dependencies**: How data is shared and modified
3. **Event Flow**: Event-driven interactions
4. **State Management**: How application state is maintained
